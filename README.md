## ⚡ System Overview
This portfolio is designed as a **hybrid command-line interface (CLI) and visual data pipeline**, representing the intersection of low-level hardware control and high-level AI orchestration.

It serves as a central hub for my work in **Agentic AI, Digital Verification (UVM), and Data Engineering**, featuring an interactive terminal for navigation and a scrollytelling experience for project visualization.
